I am sure many of you also have thought about creating this kind of project: Controlling your computer with your hand☝️

Based on my imagination, I replaced the basic functions of a mouse with my hand. My index finger and middle finger are left and right buttons respectively.
When I move down the index finger, the mouse's left button will be clicked.
When I move down the middle finger, the mouse's right button will be clicked.

As usually, I used:
- mediapipe library
- pyautogui
- opencv-python



P.S.: I speed up the video in order to shorten the video duration to less than a minute. What do you think is the main disadvantage of "controlling the screen of a computer with hand"?
